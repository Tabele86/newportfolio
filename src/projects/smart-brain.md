**Full stack web app with React.js on heroku(plus heroku postgres db) Using the Clarifai API to locate ONE face in pictures from image links.**

### Lessons learned:
How quickly things can change with React and other libraries/APIs.  Not only did React change but so did the API. Credit to Andrei Neagoie(ZTM) and his Udemy course though, he was one of the first instructors to update their course in 2020. Though I had to figure out how to implement the new Hooks and useReducer feature from 16.8 as his course was built with Classes and Redux.
