**Old portfolio I completed during my birthday weekend in December**

### Lessons learned:
I did enjoy building the site and learned a lot of bootstrap knowledge.  Just was not a fan of having to update things in so many places, to also accomodate for mobile. Plus I wanted to build a new portfolio with React but ended up exploring/learning Gatsby.js for my portfolio.
