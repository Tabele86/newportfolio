**React fan site for Adolis Garcia(outfielder for the Texas Rangers)**

### Lessons learned:
Learned quite a bit of tailwind tricks  revolving around absolute postioning and implementing css grid .  Hardest thing I struggled with was the API call because I originally tried to map the data like an array but realised that the data's format were objects in objects.  Then after deploying found out the API source was http and had to find a https source.
