**React fan site for Adolis Garcia(outfielder for Texas Rangers)**

### Lessons learned:
Learned quite a bit of tailwind tricks  revolving around absolute postioning and implementing css grid .  Hardest things I struggled was the API call because I originally trying to map the data like an array but realised that the data were objects in objects.  Then after deploying found out the source was http and had to find a https source.
