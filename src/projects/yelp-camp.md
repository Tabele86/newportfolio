**The infamous YelpCamp from Colt Steele.  Definitely learned alot about  Mongo/Mongoose and EJS**

### Lessons learnd:
I actually finished this sometime in February but had some UI issues that didn't make sense;  but life happened. Came back months later and I realized that I was using the more up to date Bootstrap CDN verse the alpha used in tutorial.
