**Star Wars Canon timeline spanning across all movies and tv, made with react and react-chrono.**

### Lessons learned:
I wanted to make a time line website and the Mandalorian season 2 was about to come out.  So I made a Star Wars cannon time line with a "time-line" API, react-chrono.  The API is very limited and has wierd padding and scrolling issues.  If I were to do it again I'd probably just use card components and figure out how to get the timeline funcionality another way.
