**Simple React blog websites utilising the sanity.io for the blob/backend.**

### Lessons learned:
Funny enough I learned sanity.io to make a portfolio site; but it was too limited and wasn't a big fan of it.  So I turned into a Nature Blog, which seemed to be the best application for a headless CMS.
